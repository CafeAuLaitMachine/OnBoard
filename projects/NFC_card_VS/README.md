# YOUR PROJECT NAME

I am making a PCB Hacker Card. It is my 1st ever PCB Project. It is a business card that can transmit a URL to my linktree and light up when tapped. It has a design to reflect my future career.

Cost: 2 + 23.27 $

Made a schematic, turned it into a PCB design, placed all the components, and even added some custom text and images and made it into a functional ruler. The Hack Club tutorial was a huge helpâ€”especially since this was my first time ever making a PCB or anything like it. I had so much fun doing it!
